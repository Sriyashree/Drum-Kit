# Drum-Kit

Here, I have attempted to create a drum kit with 7 different types of drums visible on screen, wherein the drums work as buttons, and have single letters on each of them. On clicking the images, or pressing the letters on the keyboard, the drum clicked on, or associated with the particular key on keyboard, plays the associated sound.

Here, HTML has been used to create the basic structure of the webpage, and CSS has been used to style the HTML elements. JavaScript has been used to dynamically render parts of the website, like the animation timings for triggering the event(s), linking sound files with their respective drum images, etc.

This project is from Udemy's The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp course by Dr. Angela Yu. The HTML and CSS files are from the course, while the JavaScript portion is entirely my own work.
